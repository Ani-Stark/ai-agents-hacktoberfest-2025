# What are AI Agents?

Learn all about AI agents, and what makes them so important!

An AI agent is any software that uses AI to complete tasks, without or with just a little help from humans. They are different from AI assistants, because rather than the user constantly giving tasks (usually giving answers to prompts), They have one or a few big goals decided on beforehand which they are trying to acheive. 🤖

## Examples

Some of the most well known examples of AI agents you experience in your day-to-day life are:
    - `Voice assistants` - Such as Siri, Alexa and Bixby 🎙️
    - `Self-Driving cars` - Includes Tesla and other autopilot cars 🚗
    - `Call bots` - Calls that have bots talking to you, for advertising, support, or booking 

## How do they work

- `AI agents rely on Large Language Models (LLMs)`
        - These are Huge amounts of data based on text and human language, which allows AI to speak, read, and understand human language 🗣️💬
- `AI agents also rely on Neural Networks`
        - The human brain is a very powerful computer, which is why many AI agents use neural networks, which are based off of our brains. There are these nodes (human equivalent of a neuron, our brain cell), which connect to many other nodes to connect multiple ideas together. 🧠

## What makes them great

AI agents are automated, meaning no one is required to do the task. Repetitive and basic tasks which were very tedious are now being completed entirely by AI Agents. AI agents are not influenced by emotions or other factors, making there decisions more rational and effective.

## AI vs. Python Functions 🐍

AI agents and Python functions are similar but on a very different scale. AI agents are large and run for months, with the user giving it a specific task and the agent doing it for a long time, and staying centered on that user given goal. Python functions, however, are very small and are just input-output machines. If you really think about it, AI agents and assistants are also input-output machines, the user promt and task act as the input and the answer or goal being completed act as the output.
