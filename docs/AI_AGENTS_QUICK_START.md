# AI Agents Quick Start Guide

## üìö What You'll Find in This Repository

This repository contains practical implementations of various AI agent types, demonstrating the evolution from simple rule-based systems to sophisticated LLM-powered agents.

## üéØ Quick Answers

### What are AI Agents?

AI Agents are **autonomous software entities** that can:
- **Perceive** their environment
- **Decide** on actions based on goals
- **Act** to achieve objectives
- **Learn** from interactions

Think of them as intelligent assistants that can work independently, unlike traditional functions that just execute fixed instructions.

### Why Use AI Agents vs Python Functions?

| When to Use Python Functions | When to Use AI Agents |
|------------------------------|----------------------|
| ‚úÖ Fixed, deterministic tasks | ‚úÖ Natural language input |
| ‚úÖ High-speed operations | ‚úÖ Context-aware decisions |
| ‚úÖ Simple, well-defined logic | ‚úÖ Learning from interactions |
| ‚úÖ Cost-sensitive applications | ‚úÖ Complex reasoning tasks |

**Example:**

```python
# Python Function: Fast but rigid
def calculate(a, b, operation):
    if operation == "add":
        return a + b
    elif operation == "multiply":
        return a * b
    # Must define every operation

# AI Agent: Flexible but slower
agent = CalculatorAgent()
agent.calculate("What's 15% tip on $45.50?")  # Understands natural language!
```

## ü§ñ Agent Types in This Repository

### 1. **Rule-Based Agent** (`agents/rule_based_agent/`)
Simple condition-action rules.
```python
if temperature > 25:
    turn_on_ac()
```

### 2. **Goal-Based Agent** (`agents/goal_based_agent/`)
Plans actions to achieve specific goals.
```python
plan_route(current_position, goal_position)
```

### 3. **Calculator Agent** (`agents/calculator/`)
Utility-based agent for mathematical operations.
```python
agent.calculate("Calculate compound interest on $1000 at 5% for 3 years")
```

### 4. **Chatbot Agent** (`agents/gemini_chatbot/`)
Conversational agent with memory and context.
```python
chatbot.send_message("I'm planning a trip")
chatbot.send_message("What should I pack?")  # Remembers context!
```

### 5. **Tool-Using Agent** (`agents/tool_agent/`)
Can call external functions and APIs.
```python
agent.process("What time is it and calculate 15 * 24")
# Automatically calls get_time() and calculate() functions
```

### 6. **Multi-Agent System** (`agents/content_team/`)
Multiple specialized agents collaborating.
```python
writer.write_draft(topic)
editor.review_and_improve(draft)
```

### 7. **Specialized Agents**
- **Research Agent**: Deep analysis and fact-finding
- **Code Agent**: Generate, review, and explain code
- **Search Agent**: Web search and information gathering

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Setup
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd ai-agents-hacktoberfest-2025

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1  # Windows PowerShell

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Configure API Key
Create a `.env` file:
```
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

### 3. Run Examples
```bash
# Simple chatbot
python agents/gemini_chatbot/chatbot.py

# Calculator agent
python agents/calculator/calculator.py

# Research agent
python agents/research_agent/research_agent.py
```

## üí° Key Insights from the Code

### 1. **Agents Have Structure**
Every agent follows the perception-decision-action loop:
```python
state = agent.perceive(environment)
action = agent.decide(state)
agent.act(action, environment)
```

### 2. **Agents Can Be Specialized**
Use system instructions to create focused agents:
```python
system_instruction="You are a math calculator. Always show steps."
# vs
system_instruction="You are a creative writer. Be engaging and vivid."
```

### 3. **Agents Can Collaborate**
Multiple agents working together are more powerful:
```python
class ContentTeam:
    writer = WriterAgent()
    editor = EditorAgent()
    # Each specialized for their task
```

### 4. **Agents Learn Context**
Maintain conversation history for better interactions:
```python
self.conversation_history.append({
    'user': message,
    'bot': response
})
```
